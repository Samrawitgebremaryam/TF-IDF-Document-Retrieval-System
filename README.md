# TF-IDF Document Retrieval System

## Overview

The **TF-IDF Document Retrieval System** is a Python-based application that utilizes the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm to identify and rank the top three most relevant documents in response to a user's query. This system is particularly useful for information retrieval tasks, enabling efficient and accurate document searches within a collection.

## Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization:** Transforms text data into numerical vectors, capturing the importance of terms within documents.
- **Cosine Similarity Calculation:** Measures the similarity between the query vector and each document vector to assess relevance.
- **Ranking and Retrieval:** Sorts documents based on their similarity scores and retrieves the top three most relevant ones for each query.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Allows users to input multiple queries and displays the top three relevant documents for each.
